# Day by Day

https://days.rory.codes/

A visual representation of my life, Day by Day.

Some people have said it is depressing, others inspiring. It is whatever you want it to be.

For me it serves as a reminder of the finite nature of life. It reminds me to live. To cherish those I love. To stop for a moment and enjoy the little things.

### Technical

- Built with React and Vite
- Tooltip with React-Tooltip
- Deployed via Netlify
- Styled with a single CSS file, nothing fancy
- About 12 hours from idea to initial deployment

It's a work in progress, feel free to suggest ideas. Currently the initial render produces around 30,000 <div>'s which is probably less than ideal.
